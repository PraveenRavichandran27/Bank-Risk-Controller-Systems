# Bank-Risk-Controller-Systems

## Project Overview

The Bank Risk Controller Systems project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict loan defaults. The system will utilize historical loan data to build a predictive model, evaluate its performance, and deploy it through a Streamlit application for real-time predictions.

## Skills and Technologies

- **Python**: For data preprocessing, machine learning, and model deployment.
- **Analytics & Statistics**: For data exploration and feature engineering.
- **Plotting**: Using Plotly and Seaborn for visualizations.
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- **Deep Learning**: Leveraging advanced techniques if needed.
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive dashboards and deployment.

## Problem Statement

Predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on historical loan data. The target column in the dataset is `TARGET`.

## Business Use Cases

1. **Risk Management**: Assess borrower risk and aid in loan approval decisions.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Tailor financial products based on risk profiles.
3. **Credit Scoring**: Enhance traditional credit scoring models.
4. **Fraud Detection**: Identify patterns indicative of fraudulent applications.

## Approach

### 1. Data Collection
- Gather historical loan data from the provided dataset.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the data: handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform EDA to understand data distributions and relationships between variables.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Create features that enhance the model's predictive power.

### 5. Model Selection
- Evaluate various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

### 6. Model Training
- Train the selected model(s) on the training dataset.

### 7. Model Evaluation
- Assess model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.

### 8. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimize model parameters to improve performance.

### 9. Model Deployment
- Deploy the model using a Streamlit application for real-time predictions.

## Results

### Expected Outcomes
- **Streamlit Dashboard**:
  - **Sidebar 1: Data**
    - Display the dataset and model performance metrics.
  - **Sidebar 2: EDA - Visual**
    - Perform and display EDA analysis and plots using Plotly or Seaborn.
  - **Sidebar 3: Prediction**
    - Input feature values and predict loan default status.

### Project Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC should be above 0.87 (87%).
